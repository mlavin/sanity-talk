Introduction/Overview
So you want to release your Django app into the wild. Now what? I'll go over packaging your application to add to the Python Package Index (PyPi), creating documentation to host on Read The Docs and setup an environment to test your application against different versions of Python and Django. I'll also go over some things you should and shouldn't do when maintaining your app over the years.

Packaging

Creating a setup.py
Registering your package
Uploading your package
Sane versioning with PEP386

Documentation

Getting started with Sphinx
Using Read the Docs

Testing

Running your app tests
Testing multiple Python/Django versions with tox
Testing your documentation build

Things to Do

State your goals
Let others help you

Prepare for the future

Things to Avoid

Rejecting every contribution
Accepting every contribution
Developer burnout

Conclusion
Reusable applications are my favorite feature of Django. It does take work to maintain an open source app but it can be quite rewarding. If you use these tools you can help provide your users with the best experience and empower them to help you with your application.
